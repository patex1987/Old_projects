# Old_projects

This repo is just an overview of my old projects, Later on I will upgrade it with screenshots / code snippets / detailed description

### Strain Calibration macro
I made this project at my work - written in VBA for Excel. It collects the data from different dataloggers synchronizes them and
calculates the relationship between the input and output values

Technologies used: VBA, linear regression

### Temperature Calibration macro
Almost the same as the previous one, but has a more complex algorithm to calculate the relationship

Technologies used: VBA, 2nd grade polynom regression, time and date parsing, time synchronization

### Barcode client
SW tool used in production facilities to control the workflow of a product in real-time. All work stations can be controlled wth this tool

Technologies used: C#, multi-threading, TCP-IP socket communication, Windows Forms

### Bare Fiber Color Recognizer
Automated color code recognition on multi-fiber cables using a low cost USB-microscope

Technologies used: C#, LAB color code, edge detection, image processing, Windows Forms

### Hydro/meteo/station
SW tool for enviromental monitoring of temperature - humidity - air pressure

Technologies used: C#, RS-232, Serial communication, custom GUI

### Temperature logger
Logging of data from a temperature probe in user defined intervals and format

Technologies used: C#, RS-232, Serial communication, multi-threading
